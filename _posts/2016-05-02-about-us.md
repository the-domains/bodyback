After 2 babies and for over 10 years before that, I struggled to keep my body healthy and active. I slowly counted and recorded the habits that produced the best results and saved them all. Now I am sharing all of my favorite workout tips, plans, and products and hope you find some peace after pregnancy. Any feedback is welcome and would love to hear your stories and before and after photos!"

Making a baby can take a toll on that bod... BodyBack is a site to share all of my little secrets to getting the best body that you've ever had, even post pregnancy. After 2 babies and for over 10 years before that, I struggled to keep my body healthy and active. I slowly counted and recorded the habits that produced the best results and saved them all. Now I am sharing all of my favorite workout tips, plans, and products and hope you find some peace after pregnancy. Any feedback is welcome and would love to hear your stories and before and after photos!
